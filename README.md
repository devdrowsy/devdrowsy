Hello, Drousey here, aka @devdrowsy. I'm a college sophomore that's aspiring to be a software developer, I am mainly skilled in JavaScript and React. I'm planning on working on some of my own projects with this GitHub as well as contributing to other popular open source projecs.

Project preferences:
