Hello, Drousey here, aka @devdrowsy. IDK why I put off making a GitHub for so long lol. I've been practicing a lot of React in my free time, and looking to finally contribute to React open source projects that I like to use.

Project preferences:
* Things that make day to day tasks easier
* Things that make coding/development easier

Some of my coding preferences:
* Semicolons (no, code is not prettier if you omit semis -.-)
* Tabs (i think for accessibility reasons it's nice to let devs customize how big indentation is)
* No trailing commas (i know i know, it's better for diffs but I find code harder to read with them)
